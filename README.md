# python-rtmbot-hodor
### Slack rtmbot plugin designed for hodoring.

Plugin for [python-rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) : listen for mentions of Hodor's name in slack channels and reply with a message.

Messages are pre-defined from a basic module import and classified by mood.

The 'mood' of reply is determined by comparing the content of the triggering
message against a library of words and human interpreted intent scoring. After
mood assignment, a message is chosen based on a 'item drop' type selection process
that allows for weighting of responses.
