Slack Hodor Integration
=============
Plugin for [python-rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) : listens for mentions of Hodor's name in slack
channels and reply with a message.

Messages are pre-defined from a basic module import and classified by mood.

The 'mood' of reply is determined by comparing the content of the triggering
message against a library of words and human interpreted intent scoring. After
mood assignment, a message is chosen based on a 'item drop' type selection process
that allows for weighting of responses.

## Docker
A [docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jacobsanford/slack-hodor/) has been created to deploy this service quickly.

QuickStart
-----------
1. Download the python-rtmbot code

        git clone git@github.com:slackhq/python-rtmbot.git
        cd python-rtmbot

2. Install dependencies ([virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is recommended.)

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure rtmbot (https://api.slack.com/bot-users)

        cp doc/example-config/rtmbot.conf .
        vi rtmbot.conf
          SLACK_TOKEN: "xoxb-11111111111-222222222222222"

4. Download and enable this plugin

        git submodule add -f git://github.com/JacobSanford/python-rtmbot-hodor.git plugins/hodor

5. Start

        ./rtmbot.py

Run As Daemon
-----------
If you plan on running the Slack Hodor Integration for long periods of time, you may consider using a process manager
daemon such as [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) to start and stop the rtmbot. A supervisor tutorial is available
[here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-manage-supervisor-on-ubuntu-and-debian-vps).
